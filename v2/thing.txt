kinematics:
	does forwards and backwards kinematics
	takes: reletive goal pose
	returns: joint angles
	
vision:
	keep track of world position
	returns: world position

arm:
	takes joint angles and sends them to the arm, maybe do some smoothing/pathing
	takes: joint angles
	does: sends angles to arm with gpio

main:
	get pose from vision
	work out reletive pose of target (maybe do in vision)
	move target to be valid, collision free
	gets joint angles from inverse kinematics
	?plans path
	send path to arm
